Having spent the majority of his life as a professional musician, David Luther is making the transition into the world of data science. He graduated with a BFA in Jazz Studies from the University of Michigan in 2002, then spent the next 15 years touring with various artists (including Meat Loaf and Dweezil Zappa) and performing his own music around New York City. A newfound of love of programming collided with his longstanding love of math and physics and natural tendency to frame problems around how best to use available data, resulting in the decision to pursue data science.
