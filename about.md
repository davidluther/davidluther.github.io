Having spent the majority of his life as a professional musician, David Luther is transitioning into the world of data science. He graduated with a BFA in Jazz Studies from the University of Michigan in 2002, and spent the next 15 years touring with various artists — including tenures with Meat Loaf and Dweezil Zappa — in addition to performing his own music around New York City. The time came for a career pivot; a newfound interest in both programming and machine learning collided with his longstanding love of math and physics, and data science was the clear pursuit. He recently relocated to Chicago, and completed the Metis Data Science bootcamp in December 2017.
