title: Metis Project 2 — Delays Expected
---

Our second project for Metis began with only two constraints:
1. Gather a substantial amount of data via web scraping
2. Build a linear regression model to attempt to predict a certain target

Being an aviation enthusiast of many years, I chose to look at a common complaint of many air travelers: delay. Would there perhaps be a way to predict, with any accuracy, the degree to which one might be late on a particular flight?

## Approach

I decided to focus first on arrivals at one airport (ORD) from one origin (LGA) operated by one airline (American), and expand from there if I had time. Canceled flights would not be considered. I would collect available arrival information, and calculate "lateness" by subtracting scheduled arrival from actual. This would be a simple measure of minutes, positive if late, and negative if early. Knowing the date would give me the day of the week. It was my hypothesis that some correlation might be found with lateness and both day of week and time of day.  By using these features and others to build a linear regression model, I would see how much truth this held.

## Scraping

Despite all of this information being available in a neatly-wrapped CSV file from the [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/ONTIME/Index.aspx), I decided to attempt to scrape data from one of the most popular flight data sites, which shall remain unnamed throughout this discussion. Sitting on a comprehensive trove of proprietary data, this site would much rather a user purchase their data than scrape it. Thus, they don't make scraping a particualrly simple process.

As much of the data is posted via javascript, trying to read the page object generated using the requests module with Beautiful Soup is futile. By searching for a particular `class` value, one can navigate to the `div` containing the information of interest, but the `div` contains no text whatsoever.

Before giving up and changing tack, I decided to try Selenium, just in case there might be some luck to be had there. For whatever reason, the page source of the Selenium driver object did contain the desired data (in this case, all the relevant arrival times). Since each page is constructed live from the same template, it was fairly straightforward to use Beautiful Soup to extract the data from there.

Each flight number on each day had its own page, with the date, flight number, and a unique route number comprising elements of the URL. My scraping function looped through a list of flight number/route number tuples, advancing back into the year one day at a time, manufacturing a URL string to hand off to the webdriver for each day, until it was detected that there had been no flights for seven consecutive days. In this manner, I was able to collect nearly 2000 records for 17 different flight numbers for anywhere between two and seven months, depending on the flight number.

The biggest takeaways? First, scraping is an arduous process throughout which many, many things can and will go wrong. If one doesn't properly anticipate within the scraping function how to deal with all these things (e.g. how to interpret a day on which a flight didn't exist, what to do when the driver throws a timeout exception, etc.), it will not be uncommon to wake up in the morning to see that the function stalled out at 4am, halfway through the process, with none of the data saved. Which leads to the second but larger takeaway: **work in batches and save often.** In my case, I ended up putting code into the function that pickled the database every time a new flight number's flights were added. It saved a whole lot of time in the end, and would have saved even *more* time had I done it from the beginning.

At some point, I would like to devote an entire post to the scraping process and the function used to make it happen, because it took some time to get it right, and there are a few things in it that I will do every time I scrape from here on out. But for now, onward.

## Cleaning

Though the scraping process was somewhat arduous, the resulting raw data ended up being remarkably clean, and required very little to put it into useful condition. Here are the steps:

1. Convert all dates/times to datetime.
2. Add several new columns:
  * Lateness of gate arrival (minutes, actual gate arrival minus scheduled gate arrival) (**Target**)
  * Lateness of landing (minutes, actual landing minus scheduled landing)
  * Scheduled taxi time (minutes, scheduled gate arrival minus scheduled landing)
  * Day of week (0-6, by calling the `.weekday()` method on the scheduled arrival datetime objects)
  * Hour of day (0-23, by extracting the `.hour` attribute from scheduled arrival)
  * Quarter of day (0-3, simple chain of if-statements on hour of day)
3. Advance date for late-night arrivals — all datetime objects were stamped with the date on which the flight was scheduled to fly, so a 1am actual arrival would appear to have occurred nearly a full day before an 11pm scheduled arrival. When such impossibly-early lateness values were detected, the actual arrival times were rolled forward one day.
4. Drop records where scheduled taxi time < 0 — this indicated that the scheduled landing time came after the scheduled arrival time, a situation for which I had no concrete explanation.
5. Drop extremely late outliers.

To the latter, it was clear that my model was only going to be able to detect regular fluxuations due to trends of the schedule, and would have no ability to predict the extremes delays resulting from unpredictables such as weather, mechanical problems, air traffic control backups, etc. As such, I decided there needed to be some sort of threshold beyond which a record would not be used to train and test the model. For an idea of the distribution, here is a histogram of all lateness of gate arrival values:

![Histogram of gate arrival lateness](/images/metis_p2/02_hist_lateness_pre.png)

Here, it is clear that the vast majority of lateness values fall between -60 minutes and 60 minutes, with an ever decreasing number of values represented up until just over 10 hours (a very unfortunate flight indeed). I was surprised to see that the mode of the distribution falls below zero — indeed, most flights are early, with a median lateness of -12 minutes and a mean just under zero.

![Box plot of gate arrival lateness](/images/metis_p2/02_box_lateness_pre.png)

This box plot shows the distribution in a little more detail, and highlights the outliers beyond the upper whisker. At 1.5 times the IQR beyond the 3rd quartile, the lateness value here is 51 minutes. As it seemed arguable that any lateness values beyond this point would be caused by some sort of extreme and unpredictable event, I decided to use it as my threshold, and dropped records with lateness values in excess.

At this point, I also peeled off the final week of arrivals for use as a validation set after the model had been assembled.

## Further Exploration

Given the task of selecting features that might have some power in predicting lateness, I chose to first look at lateness by day of week and time of day.

![Box plot of lateness by weekday](/images/metis_p2/02_weekday_box.png)

General variance appears to be similar from day to day. Median values on Monday through Thursday are almost identical, then Friday's is a few minutes later, with Saturday's and Sunday's a few minutes earlier. Though there appears to be a slight trend, the median only varies within a 15 minute range, which is small considering the nearly 2-hour range of lateness values.

![Box plot of lateness by quarter of day](/images/metis_p2/02_quarter_box.png)

Because there are no flights scheduled to arrive between midnight and 6am, there are only three quarters displayed. There appears to be more variance as the day goes on, which intuitively makes sense, as irregularities in the schedule could compound throughout the day, widening the range come evening. The median doesn't vary more than 10 minutes from quarter to quarter, with the afternoon being the earliest of the three. 

![Taxi time v. lateness, Hist of landing lateness](/images/metis_p2/02_taxi_landing.png)

Scheduled taxi time remained the last feature for which I had any hope as a predictor, and the first plot on the left shows no obvious visual correlation with lateness of gate arrival. It is curious, though, that there would be two distinct groupings for scheduled taxi time (this is true for each day of the week). As lateness of landing (right plot) shows a similar bimodal distribution, and both were derived from the same arrival times, they are clearely related. As yet though, I still have no particularly good explanation as to why.

![Heat map of correlation](/images/metis_p2/02_heatmap.png)

Looking at a heat map of correlations, we see very little evidence of correlation between any of the features and the target, the strongest magnitude being found with weekday (-0.14). Not surprisingly, quarter of day and hour of day show a great deal of colinearity, so it would likely be best to use one or the other when selecting possible features.
