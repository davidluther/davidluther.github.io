## Getting Started
This is a test post about nothing in particular.

Isn't this just the cutest squirrel you've ever seen?

I found it on [this blog post on red squirrels](http://beauty-animal.blogspot.com/2011/12/red-squirrel.html), which is worth a read if you feel the need to procrastinate.

## Moving On
Here's a list of a few things I need to get later.

#### Grocery List
* bananas (23)
* beer (lots)
* trash bags (blue)
* chicken wings (>300)
